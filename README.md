# Python Mad Libs

In this project, weâ€™ll use Python to write a Mad Libs word game!

Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

- A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
- Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

## Implementation

You need to have Python 3 installed and on your terminal enter the command below to run this program:

```shell
py script.py
```

## Notes

For the project I used Python 2 string formatting syntax which uses '%' while the current Python 3 uses curly brackets and [format() method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp) to combine strings with variables
